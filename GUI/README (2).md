# Setup instruction for the GUI

* Install node JS [Node.js — Download Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)
* move into GUI folder
* run the command npm install ( all of the modules will be installed )
* run the command npm start to run the web application

on your remote computer, ros should be runned before the web application, in the opposite case everything will still work fine but with some delay.
