## Collaboration Guidelines

Hello everyone! Please make a branch from the main branch and add your files for review so we can work together effectively. 

### 🤝 Collaboration Rules

- **Branching:** Always create a branch from the main branch for your files and changes. This ensures an organized workflow and allows others to review your contributions before merging.

- **Issues:** In case of accomplishing any task or facing a problem, please mention it in the **Issues** tab so everyone is aware.

- **Projects:** Check the **Projects** tab to see the tasks you have been assigned and the progress of the project. This will help us divide tasks efficiently and keep track of everyone's contributions.

### 🛠️ Workflow Tips

- **Stay Updated:** Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting new work

- **Communicate Clearly:** When creating issues or pull requests (PRs), provide detailed descriptions, relevant screenshots, or logs if needed.

- **Review Work Thoroughly:** Review others' PRs and leave constructive feedback. This improves the quality of the project and fosters teamwork.

### 📖 Why This Workflow?

By following this structure:
- Tasks are clearly assigned and tracked.
- Everyone stays informed about project progress.
- It simplifies documenting the project later.
