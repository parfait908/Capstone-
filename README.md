# Capstone Project

Welcome to the Capstone Project repository! This repository is dedicated to the development and simulation of our robot project.

## Instructions

### 1. Creating a Branch
Please create a new branch from the `main` branch for your work. Name your branch according to the task you're working on (e.g., `task-name`).

### 2. Uploading Your Files
Once you've made progress on your task, upload your files to your branch. If possible, include any relevant pictures or videos related to your work. This will help in creating a complete package for the robot simulation.

### 3. Updating Other Branches
Don‚Äôt forget to regularly check and update other branches. Collaboration is key, so make sure you stay up-to-date with the latest changes made by others.

### 4. Project Management
If you've managed to complete any task or feature, please:

- Add the task/item to the project board.
- Mention the status of the task (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed", "Pending").
- This will greatly help in writing the project report and tracking progress.

## Contributions
